General git commands
This guide assumes that you're already in the working directory, if not use cd PATH_TO_WORKING_DIRECTORY to change directories
Picked from this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ-qvsxPHpY


### To initialise an new directory ###
You only have to do this once and only if it has not already been done before previously in the folder that you downloaded
Use: git init


### To add files or changes ###
Use: 

git add FILE1 FILE2 .... for specific file 

or 

gid add . for all files


### To commit changes, i.e. give them a name ###
Use: git commit -m "DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES"


### To see a log of all changes ###
Use: git log


### To jump to a specific commit ###
Use git log to find the change to go back to and get its commit id then do

git checkout COMMIT_ID

note that this will put you in a different branch


### To push your changes to a branch ####
Use: git push -u origin BRANCH_NAME


### To create and change into a new branch ###
Use: git checkout -b NEW_BRANCH_NAME

------------> Main
	\___ New Branch to make changes

Think of it as saving onto another save file so you don't overwrite your main one


### To pull changes from a branch ###
Use: git pull origin BRANCH_NAME

This can be used to keep your existing local copy in sync with the one online


### To clone an entire repo ###
Use: git clone URL

NOTE: git pull only pulls in files that have changed, git clone just replaces your local copy



### Simple demonstration ###
Assuming that you're pulling from an existing repo


git clone URL # Clone remote repo

cd into the cloned directory

git checkout -b NEW_BRANCH_NAME # Create a new branch and switch to it

Now you can make whatever changes to the files you want here, after you're done do

git add . # Add changes

git commit -m "MEANINGFUL MESSAGE" # Give your changes a name

git push -u origin NEW_BRANCH_NAME # Push your commit online into your branch

You can now go to github and start a pull request to get your changes merged
